<para id="fs-idp41557488">The largest database<footnote id="fs-idp69619904">This is the Beilstein database, now available through the Reaxys site (www.elsevier.com/online-tools/reaxys).</footnote> of organic compounds lists about 10 million substances, which include compounds originating from living organisms and those synthesized by chemists. The number of potential organic compounds has been estimated<footnote id="fs-idp41278192">Peplow, Mark. “Organic Synthesis: The Robo-Chemist,” <emphasis effect="italics">Nature</emphasis> 512 (2014): 20–2.</footnote> at 10<sup>60</sup>—an astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic molecules is a consequence of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon atoms, resulting in chains and rings of many different sizes, shapes, and complexities.</para>
<para id="fs-idp68083216">The simplest <term id="term-00001">organic compounds</term> contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called hydrocarbons. Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of hydrocarbons because they may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon atoms, or combinations of these structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon bonds present in their molecules. Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other hydrocarbons have been prepared in the laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as natural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. The familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish several types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding between carbon atoms. This leads to differences in geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals.</para>

<title>Alkanes</title>
<para id="fs-idp68413472"><term id="term-00002">Alkanes</term>, or <term id="term-00003">saturated hydrocarbons</term>, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the carbon atoms in an alkane has <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either carbon or hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>. Carbon chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember that Lewis structures are not intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in the structural models (the ball-and-stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a straight line. Because of the <emphasis effect="italics">sp</emphasis><sup>3</sup> hybridization, the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving such chains in an alkane a zigzag shape.</para>
<para id="fs-idp72306672">The structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by condensed structural formulas (or simply, <emphasis effect="italics">condensed formulas</emphasis>). Instead of the usual format for chemical formulas in which each element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the bonding in the molecule. These formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of the bond symbols have been removed. Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at the bottom of <link target-id="CNX_Chem_20_01_alkanes"/>, and several additional examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this chapter.</para>

<para id="fs-idp81678112">A common method used by organic chemists to simplify the drawings of larger molecules is to use a <term id="term-00004">skeletal structure</term> (also called a line-angle structure).

<title>The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes</title>
<para id="fs-idp41465856">The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">IUPAC</term>) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:</para>
<list id="fs-idp9620576" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in <link target-id="fs-idp53743808"/>.</item>
<item>Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of <term id="term-00006">substituents</term>. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.</item>
