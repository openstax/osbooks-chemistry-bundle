<para id="fs-idm108621792">For almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure, predict the electron-pair geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to predicting bond angles. However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule O<sub>2</sub>, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would write the following Lewis structure for O<sub>2</sub>:</para>
<media id="fs-idm39755904" alt="A Lewis structure is shown. It is made up of two oxygen atoms, each with two lone pairs of electrons, bonded together with a double bond.">

<para id="fs-idm179265392">This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O<sub>2</sub> is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_00_LiqO2" document="m51054"/>. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called <term id="term-00001">paramagnetism</term>, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of O<sub>2</sub> indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?</para>
<para id="fs-idm140344208">Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_04_Gouy"/>), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.</para>

<para id="fs-idm167869376">Experiments show that each O<sub>2</sub> molecule has two unpaired electrons. The Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons.

Materials in which all of the electrons are paired are <term id="term-00003">diamagnetic</term> and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.</para>

<para id="fs-idm112096224">Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are <emphasis effect="italics">delocalized</emphasis> over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors, others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. <link target-id="fs-idm162808816"/> summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories.

<para id="fs-idp11259136">While the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs, computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_04_HIVProteas"/>). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.</para>

<title>Bond Order</title>

<para id="fs-idm84042704">When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe the same phenomenon.</para>

<para id="fs-idm113916160">The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li<sub>2</sub>, is analogous to the formation of H<sub>2</sub>, but the atomic orbitals involved are the valence 2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the σ<sub>2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis></sub> bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding orbital, we would predict the Li<sub>2</sub> molecule to be stable. The molecule is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at temperatures near the boiling point of the element.

The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.</para>

<title>Band Theory</title>
<para id="fs-idm82290832">When two identical atomic orbitals on different atoms combine, two molecular orbitals result (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_04_ssigma"/>). The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are in-phase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.</para>
<para id="fs-idm4324976">In a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically > 10<sup>23</sup> atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>/2 (filled) bonding orbitals and <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis>/2 (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are <emphasis effect="italics">mostly</emphasis> in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are <emphasis effect="italics">mostly</emphasis> out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. <link target-id="CNX_Chem_08_04_Band"/> shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_08_04_Band"><media id="fs-idp263742416" alt="This figure shows three diagrams. The first is labeled, “Insulator,” and it consists of two boxes. The “conduction” box is above and the “valence” box is below. A large gap marked by 4 dashed lines contains a double-headed arrow. One head pointing towards the “conduction box” and the other towards the “valence” box. The arrow is labeled, “Band gap.” The second diagram is similar to the first, but the band gap is about half as large. This diagram is labeled, “Semiconductor.” The third diagram is similar to the other two, but the band gap is about a fifth that of the “Semiconductor” diagram. This diagram is labeled, “Conductor.”">

<caption>Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the “band gap” between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp22163776">In order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is “easy” to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so “large” that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when “moderate” amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.</para>
<para id="fs-idm16313536">Semiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells. Solar cells produce electricity when light provides the energy to move electrons out of the valence band. The electricity that is generated may then be used to power a light or tool, or it can be stored for later use by charging a battery. As of December 2014, up to 46% of the energy in sunlight could be converted into electricity using solar cells. </para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm157944352">Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called σ MOs. They can be formed from <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> orbitals or from <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called π orbitals.</para>
<para id="fs-idm113162704">We can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund’s rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.</para>
