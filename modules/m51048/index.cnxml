<para id="fs-idp18344448">Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions that are typically produced by the transfer of electrons between metallic and nonmetallic atoms. A different type of bonding results from the mutual attraction of atoms for a “shared” pair of electrons. Such bonds are called <term>covalent bonds</term>. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an H<sub>2</sub> molecule; each hydrogen atom in the H<sub>2</sub> molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He.

</para><para id="fs-idm46739904">Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity in any state.</para>

<title>Formation of Covalent Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-idp19293424">Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_02_Morse"/> illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis), their valence orbitals (1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis>) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The <term>bond length</term> is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.</para>

The point “0.74” is labeled, “H bond H distance.” A line is graphed that begins near the top of the y-axis and to the far left on the x-axis and drops steeply to a point labeled, “negative 7.24 times 10 superscript negative 19 J” on the y-axis and 0.74 on the x-axis. This low point on the graph corresponds to a drawing of two spheres that overlap considerably. The line then rises to zero on the y-axis and levels out. The point where it almost reaches zero corresponds to two spheres that overlap slightly. The line at zero on the y-axis corresponds to two spheres that are far from one another.">

<title>Pure vs. Polar Covalent Bonds</title>
<para id="fs-idp9596128">If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in the bond must be shared equally.

<para id="fs-idp15241984">The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are identical, Cl<sub>2</sub> also features a pure covalent bond.</para>
<para id="fs-idp26845616">When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared, but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This unequal distribution of electrons is known as a <term>polar covalent bond</term>, characterized by a partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice versa. For example, the electrons in the H–Cl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule, the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge. <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_02_HClBond"/> shows the distribution of electrons in the H–Cl bond. Note that the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H.

<title>Electronegativity</title>
<para id="fs-idm42504736">Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding atoms called <term>electronegativity</term>. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.</para>
<para id="fs-idm49461456"><link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_02_ENTable"/> shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_02_Pauling"/>). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO<sub>2</sub> do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)</para>

<title>Electronegativity versus Electron Affinity</title>
<para id="fs-idp19127744">We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.</para>

<title>Electronegativity and Bond Type</title>
<para id="fs-idp186399536">The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) of two bonded atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and, thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic. The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds H–H, H–Cl, and Na–Cl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1 (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic bonding). <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_02_DeltaEN"/> shows the relationship between electronegativity difference and bond type.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idp86079584">Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.</para>
