<section id="eip-840"><title>Molecular and Empirical Formulas</title>
<para id="fs-idm194401296">A <term id="term-00001">molecular formula</term> is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds.</para>
<para id="fs-idp69721696">The <term id="term-00002">structural formula</term> for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_MethaneRep"/>). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms.</para>

<para id="fs-idm155780176">Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example, most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular formulas H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Other elements commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>), chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). The most common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S<sub>8</sub> (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Sulfur"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm43786912">It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H<sub>2</sub> and 2H represent distinctly different species. H<sub>2</sub> is a molecular formula; it represents a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H<sub>2</sub> represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Hydrogen"/>).</para>

The diagram for 2 H shows two white spheres that are not bonded together. It is labeled 2 H atoms. The diagram for H subscript 2 shows two white spheres bonded together. It is labeled one H subscript 2 molecule. The diagram for 2 H subscript 2 shows two sets of bonded, white spheres. It is labeled 2 H subscript 2 molecules.">

<para id="fs-idp204410336">Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an <term id="term-00003">empirical formula</term>, which indicates the types of atoms present and <emphasis effect="italics">the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound</emphasis>. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This identifies the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the element titanium (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_TiO2"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm68758768">As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which the subscripts indicate the <emphasis effect="italics">actual numbers of atoms</emphasis> of each element in a molecule of the compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">molecular mass</term> (the sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Benzene"/>).</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Benzene"><media id="fs-idp26487712" alt="Figure A shows that benzene is composed of six carbons shaped like a hexagon.

<para id="fs-idm49637696">If we know a compound’s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic acid (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_AceticAcid"/>) contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O. Note that a molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.</para>

  <title>Paula Hammond</title>
  <para id="fs-idp191392048">You’ve learned about the evolution of atomic theory, and you’ve started to explore different chemical structures. These structures result in molecules attracting or repelling each other, or help them arrange into our cell membranes or lead them to either spread into thin films or clump into solid masses.</para>
  <para id="fs-idm175319872">What do these structures mean to scientists, and to us?  Essentially, everything. It’s the structure and makeup of a molecule on a virus surface that allows it to attach to one of our cells, and it’s the structure and makeup of antibodies—substances created by our immune system—that block that attachment. Chlorophyll’s structure enables it to use the sun’s energy to make glucose. Chemists and chemical engineers don’t simply observe and understand these structures—they can create new ones.</para>

  <caption>Paula Hammond pioneered new techniques to precisely formulate chemical structures. Hammond’s work applies to cancer treatments, wound healing, cataract medicine, and fuel cells. Widely recognized as a leader in the field, she has won numerous awards and has been elected to various prestigious positions and fellowships by her peers and the U.S. government. She chairs the chemical engineering department at MIT, which is usually ranked as one of the best engineering and science institutions in the world.

  <para id="para-00002">Paula Hammond does exactly that to solve challenging problems ranging from cancer to energy consumption. She is the chair of the department of chemical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and leads a research team focused on assembling unique molecular structures. They have created cancer drug carriers—nanoparticle-sized coatings that enable medicines to travel into tumors without being affected by its defenses—that can deliver pharmaceuticals directly into cancerous tumors. They build these “stealth” molecules layer by layer; using certain properties of electricity and chemical behavior, they can “tune” the coatings to address particular cancers and other variables. This precision approach is necessary to treat cancers more effectively and with less harm to the patient. The company Hammond founded uses similar technology to release medication into cataract patients’ eyes, as well as to improve wound healing.</para>
  <para id="para-00003">While Hammond’s research team is composed of established and leading experts such as herself, students certainly play a role. College research labs are typically full of PhD, graduate, and even undergraduate students who participate in the work. And thus chemists and chemical engineers who use their knowledge to solve problems are also supporting the next generation of creators and problem-solvers.</para>

<para id="fs-idm101901088">It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? And if so, what would be the structure of its molecules?</para>
<para id="fs-idp29766960">If you predict that another compound with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate, which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules. Acetic acid and methyl formate are examples of <term id="term-00006">isomers</term>—compounds with the same chemical formula but different molecular structures (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Isomers"/>). Note that this small difference in the arrangement of the atoms has a major effect on their respective chemical properties. You would certainly not want to use a solution of methyl formate as a substitute for a solution of acetic acid (vinegar) when you make salad dressing.</para>

<para id="fs-idm177313504">Many types of isomers exist (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_04_Isomers2"/>). Acetic acid and methyl formate are <term id="term-00007">structural isomers</term>, compounds in which the molecules differ in how the atoms are connected to each other. There are also various types of <term id="term-00008">spatial isomers</term>, in which the relative orientations of the atoms in space can be different.

</note><section id="eip-109"><title>The Mole</title><para id="fs-idm38739232">The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the <emphasis effect="italics">mole</emphasis>, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.</para>
<para id="fs-idp4269776">The <emphasis effect="italics">mole</emphasis> is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of <emphasis effect="italics">the number</emphasis> of atoms or molecules in a sample of matter. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth. A <term id="term-00009">mole</term> of substance is that amount in which there are 6.02214076 × 10<sup>23</sup> discrete entities (atoms or molecules). This large number is a fundamental constant known as <term id="term-00010">Avogadro's number (N<sub>A</sub>)</term> or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro.  This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version being 6.022 <m:math><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:math> 10<sup>23</sup>/mol.</para>
<para id="fs-idm42768912">Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different.

</table><para id="fs-idp18068224">While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_03_02_water"/>). Although this represents just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (~18 g), it contains more water molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100 billion molecules.</para>

<para id="fs-idm4828384">The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadro’s number can be applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and calculate the substance’s mass.</para>

<title>Counting Neurotransmitter Molecules in the Brain</title>
<para id="fs-idm4217280">The brain is the control center of the central nervous system (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_03_01_brain"/>). It sends and receives signals to and from muscles and other internal organs to monitor and control their functions; it processes stimuli detected by sensory organs to guide interactions with the external world; and it houses the complex physiological processes that give rise to our intellect and emotions. The broad field of neuroscience spans all aspects of the structure and function of the central nervous system, including research on the anatomy and physiology of the brain. Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN Initiative, a federal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through the concerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (see <link url="https://openstax.org/l/16BRAINInit">BRAIN Initiative website</link> for details).</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_03_01_brain"><media id="fs-idp71769904" alt="Two pictures are shown. The left picture shows the human brain. The right picture is a microscopic image that depicts two large irregularly shaped masses in a field of threadlike material interspersed with smaller, relatively round masses. The two larger masses are labeled with arrows and the phrase “Neuron cells.”">

<caption>(a) A typical human brain weighs about 1.5 kg and occupies a volume of roughly 1.1 L. (b) Information is transmitted in brain tissue and throughout the central nervous system by specialized cells called neurons (micrograph shows cells at 1600× magnification).</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm14541088">Specialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by way of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons when one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between the cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are stored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell membrane and then break open to release their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see <link target-id="CNX_Chem_03_01_exocytosis"/>). One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Dopamine is involved in various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in the dopamine systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.</para><figure id="CNX_Chem_03_01_exocytosis">
<media id="fs-idp18792480" alt="Two diagrams are shown. In the upper left corner of the left diagram, an oval with a darkened center that has five short, branching appendages and one long tail-like appendage is shown and connected by an arrow to another image. This image depicts a close-up view of the oval section and its interaction with the tail-like portion of a similar structure. The close up view is composed of a narrow tube labeled “neuron” leading down to a bulbous base that holds thirteen circles filled with small dots. These circles are labeled “vesicles.” The base of the bulbous structure is next to a curved object labeled “neuron” and very small dots are emerging from the bulb’s base and flowing toward the curved structure. The gap in between the two structures is labeled “synapse,” and the small dots are labeled “neurotransmitters.” The diagram on the right depicts a molecule composed of six black spheres connected by alternating double and single bonds in a hexagonal ring with other spheres attached to it. Three of the black spheres are connected to one smaller, white sphere each. Two of the black balls are connected to a smaller red sphere each. Each red sphere is connected to a smaller, white sphere. One black sphere is connected to another black sphere. It is connected to two smaller, white spheres and another black sphere. This second black sphere is connected to two smaller white spheres, and a slightly smaller blue sphere. The blue sphere is connected to two smaller, white spheres.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-idp15499232">One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of neurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining neurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number changes with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to understand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules released—for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or a change in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle.</para>
<para id="fs-idm2962416">Significant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules stored in individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using miniaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have determined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine molecules per vesicle (about <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>5</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>−20</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> mol or 50 zmol). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to various drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in individual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These studies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting that it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical therapies.<footnote id="fs-idp50539888">Omiatek, Donna M., Amanda J.

<para id="fs-idm100378720">A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole.
