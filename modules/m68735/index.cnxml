<para id="fs-idm133801872">The elements in groups (vertical columns) of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical behavior. This similarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and distribution of electrons in their valence shells. However, there are also other patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For example, as we move down a group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group 16 (6A), is a colorless gas; in the middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting solid; and, toward the bottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that conducts electricity.</para>
<para id="fs-idm139046976">As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an electron to the valence shell with each successive element. As we go down the elements in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains constant, but the principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their chemical behavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the elements changes. They are (1) size (radius) of atoms and ions, (2) ionization energies, and (3) electron affinities.</para>

<section id="fs-idm46575248"><title>Variation in Covalent Radius</title>
<para id="fs-idm81399712">The quantum mechanical picture makes it difficult to establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the <term id="term-00001">covalent radius</term> (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_CovalradiT"/>), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis>, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in <link target-id="fs-idp28766560"/> and <link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_CovalradiT"/>. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_CovalradiT"/>.</para>

<media id="fs-idm144132800" alt="This figure has two parts: a and b. In figure a, four diatomic molecules are shown to illustrate the method of determining the atomic radius of an atom. The first model, in light green, is used to find the F atom radius. Two spheres are pushed very tightly together. The distance between the centers of the two atoms is indicated above the diagram with a double-headed arrow labeled “128 picometers (pm).” The end points of this arrow connect to line segments that extend to the atomic radii below. Beneath the molecule is the label, “F radius equals 128 pm divided by 2 equals 64 pm.” The next three models are similarly used to show the atomic radii of additional atoms. The second diatomic molecule is in a darker shade of green. The distance between the radii is 198 pm. Beneath the molecule is the label, “Cl radius equals 198 pm divided by 2 equals 99 pm.” The third diatomic molecule is in red. The distance between the radii is 228 pm. Beneath the molecule is the label, “Br radius equals 228 pm divided by 2 equals 114 pm.” The fourth diatomic molecule is in purple. The distance between the radii is 266 pm. Beneath the molecule is the label, “I radius equals 266 pm divided by 2 equals 133 pm.” In figure b, a periodic table layout is used to compare relative sizes of atoms, using green spheres. No spheres are provided for the noble or inert gas—group 18 elements. General trends noted are increasing circle size moving from top to bottom in a group, with a general tendency toward increasing atomic radii toward the lower left corner of the periodic table.">

<para id="fs-idm121307184">As shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_Radiigraph"/>, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of <term id="term-00002">effective nuclear charge, <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis><sub>eff</sub></term>. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron–electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge (<emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis>) and the effective nuclear charge (<emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis><sub>eff</sub>) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially <emphasis effect="italics">shield</emphasis> the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:</para>
<equation class="unnumbered" id="fs-idm124657104"><m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>Z</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>eff</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>Z</m:mi><m:mo>−</m:mo><m:mi>s</m:mi><m:mi>h</m:mi><m:mi>i</m:mi><m:mi>e</m:mi><m:mi>l</m:mi><m:mi>d</m:mi><m:mi>i</m:mi><m:mi>n</m:mi><m:mi>g</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math></equation>
<para id="fs-idm139062592">Shielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron–electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis> increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis><sub>eff</sub> increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.</para>
<para id="fs-idm117962416">Thus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the <emphasis effect="italics">ns</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">np</emphasis> electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the <emphasis effect="italics">ns</emphasis> electrons before they begin to lose the (<emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> – 1)<emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> electrons, even though the <emphasis effect="italics">ns</emphasis> electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.</para>

<para id="fs-idm83408752">Ionic radius is the measure used to describe the size of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same number of protons as the parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_Ionradii"/>).

<para id="fs-idm65452096">Cations with larger charges are smaller than cations with smaller charges (e.g., V<sup>2+</sup> has an ionic radius of 79 pm, while that of V<sup>3+</sup> is 64 pm).

<para id="fs-idm145149808">An anion (negative ion) is formed by the addition of one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results in a greater repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis><sub>eff</sub> per electron. Both effects (the increased number of electrons and the decreased <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis><sub>eff</sub>) cause the radius of an anion to be larger than that of the parent atom (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_Ionradii"/>). For example, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>3<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis><sup>4</sup>) has a covalent radius of 104 pm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>3<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis><sup>6</sup>) is 170 pm.

<para id="fs-idp85408992">The energy required to remove the third electron is the third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are always positive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period.</para>
<para id="fs-idm79820288"><link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_Firstiongr"/> graphs the relationship between the first ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements.

Within a period, the IE<sub>1</sub> generally increases with increasing <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis>. Down a group, the IE<sub>1</sub> value generally decreases with increasing <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis>. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as <emphasis effect="italics">l</emphasis> increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> electrons are lower in energy than the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> electrons. This means that an <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> electron is harder to remove from an atom than a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ([He]2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>) is an <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ([He]2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis><sup>2</sup>2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis><sup>1</sup>) is a <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton.

<para id="fs-idm10621984">Removing an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in <link target-id="fs-idp3693744"/>, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.</para><table id="fs-idp3693744" class="top-titled" summary="This table has eight columns and seven rows.

<para id="fs-idm33809440">This process can be either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is given in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_06_05_Elaffin"/>. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an electron to an anion to form a –2 ion, and so on.</para>
<para id="fs-idp8026512">As we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron must be added to a higher <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has a filled <emphasis effect="italics">ns</emphasis> subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy <emphasis effect="italics">np</emphasis>, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled <emphasis effect="italics">np</emphasis> subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing <emphasis effect="italics">np</emphasis> electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend in EA.</para>
<para id="fs-idp68162064">We also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that the <emphasis effect="italics">second</emphasis> element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed to the small size of the <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 2 shell and the resulting large electron–electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of –348 kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is –322 kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion (F<sup>–</sup>), we add an electron to the <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 2 shell. The electron is attracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going into the <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron–electron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.</para>

<caption>This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in kJ/mol) for selected elements.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idm144469568">The properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.</para>

<section id="fs-idp4924224" class="summary"><title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm92804752">Electron configurations allow us to understand many periodic trends. Covalent radius increases as we move down a group because the <emphasis effect="italics">n</emphasis> level (orbital size) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation) decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic) when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus. Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing with completely filled or half-filled subshells.</para>
