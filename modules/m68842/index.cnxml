<para id="fs-idm272953936">Transition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbitals. As shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_01_PeriodicEConfig"/>, the <term><emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block elements</term> in groups 3–11 are transition elements. The <term><emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis>-block elements</term>, also called <emphasis effect="italics">inner transition metals</emphasis> (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbital is partially occupied before the <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis> orbitals. The <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the next family (group 12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12 elements as transition metals.</para>

<media id="fs-idm272821040" alt="The Periodic Table of Elements is shown. The 18 columns are labeled “Group” and the 7 rows are labeled “Period.” Below the table to the right is a box labeled “Color Code” with different colors for metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, as well as solids, liquids, and gases. To the left of this box is an enlarged picture of the upper-left most box on the table. The number 1 is in its upper-left hand corner and is labeled “Atomic number.” The letter “H” is in the middle in red indicating that it is a gas. It is labeled “Symbol.” Below that is the number 1.008 which is labeled “Atomic Mass.” Below that is the word hydrogen which is labeled “name.” The color of the box indicates that it is a nonmetal. Each element will be described in this order: atomic number; name; symbol; whether it is a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal; whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas; and atomic mass.

<title>Uses of Lanthanides in Devices</title>
<para id="fs-idm24167088">Lanthanides (elements 57–71) are fairly abundant in the earth’s crust, despite their historic characterization as <term>rare earth elements</term>. Thulium, the rarest naturally occurring lanthanoid, is more common in the earth’s crust than silver (4.5 <m:math><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:math> 10<sup>−5</sup>% versus 0.79 <m:math><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:math> 10<sup>−5</sup>% by mass). There are 17 rare earth elements, consisting of the 15 lanthanoids plus scandium and yttrium. They are called rare because they were once difficult to extract economically, so it was rare to have a pure sample; due to similar chemical properties, it is difficult to separate any one lanthanide from the others. However, newer separation methods, such as ion exchange resins similar to those found in home water softeners, make the separation of these elements easier and more economical. Most ores that contain these elements have low concentrations of all the rare earth elements mixed together.</para>
<para id="fs-idm256905072">The commercial applications of lanthanides are growing rapidly. For example, europium is important in flat screen displays found in computer monitors, cell phones, and televisions. Neodymium is useful in laptop hard drives and in the processes that convert crude oil into gasoline (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_01_Lanthanoid"/>). Holmium is found in dental and medical equipment. In addition, many alternative energy technologies rely heavily on lanthanoids. Neodymium and dysprosium are key components of hybrid vehicle engines and the magnets used in wind turbines.</para>

<para id="fs-idm272757680">As the demand for lanthanide materials has increased faster than supply, prices have also increased. In 2008, dysprosium cost $110/kg; by 2014, the price had increased to $470/kg. Increasing the supply of lanthanoid elements is one of the most significant challenges facing the industries that rely on the optical and magnetic properties of these materials.</para>

<para id="fs-idm102288080">The transition elements have many properties in common with other metals. They are almost all hard, high-melting solids that conduct heat and electricity well. They readily form alloys and lose electrons to form stable cations. In addition, transition metals form a wide variety of stable <term>coordination compounds</term>, in which the central metal atom or ion acts as a Lewis acid and accepts one or more pairs of electrons. Many different molecules and ions can donate lone pairs to the metal center, serving as Lewis bases. In this chapter, we shall focus primarily on the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series.</para>

<title>Properties of the Transition Elements</title>
<para id="fs-idm265281664">Transition metals demonstrate a wide range of chemical behaviors. As can be seen from their reduction potentials (see <link document="m68866">Appendix H</link>), some transition metals are strong reducing agents, whereas others have very low reactivity. For example, the lanthanides all form stable 3+ aqueous cations. The driving force for such oxidations is similar to that of alkaline earth metals such as Be or Mg, forming Be<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. On the other hand, materials like platinum and gold have much higher reduction potentials. Their ability to resist oxidation makes them useful materials for constructing circuits and jewelry.</para><para id="fs-idm124317440">Ions of the lighter <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block elements, such as Cr<sup>3+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup>, form colorful hydrated ions that are stable in water. However, ions in the period just below these (Mo<sup>3+</sup>, Ru<sup>3+</sup>, and Ir<sup>2+</sup>) are unstable and react readily with oxygen from the air. The majority of simple, water-stable ions formed by the heavier <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block elements are oxyanions such as <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mtext>MoO</m:mtext><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub><m:msup><m:mrow/><m:mtext>2−</m:mtext></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> and <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mtext>ReO</m:mtext><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:msub><m:msup><m:mrow/><m:mtext>−</m:mtext></m:msup><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></para>

With difficulty, they form simple cations that are stable in water, and, unlike the earlier elements in the second and third transition series, they do not form stable oxyanions.</para>
<para id="fs-idm273645328">Both the <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>- and <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis>-block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is often required. These elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in oxidation state from 1+ to 6+. On heating, oxygen reacts with all of the transition elements except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The oxides of these latter metals can be formed using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis>-block elements, the elements of group 3, and the elements of the first transition series except copper react with aqueous solutions of acids, forming hydrogen gas and solutions of the corresponding salts.</para>

Some of the observed oxidation states of the elements of the first transition series are shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_01_Oxistatra"/>. As we move from left to right across the first transition series, we see that the number of common oxidation states increases at first to a maximum towards the middle of the table, then decreases. The values in the table are typical values; there are other known values, and it is possible to synthesize new additions.

<caption>Transition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-idm168637008">For the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the <emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two 3<emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> and two 4<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> electrons. These highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from 2+ to 6+, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of 2+ or 3+ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air.</para>
<para id="fs-idm217974912">The elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For example, molybdenum and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in aqueous solution. Chromium, the lightest member of the group, forms stable Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions in water and, in the absence of air, less stable Cr<sup>2+</sup> ions. The sulfide with the highest oxidation state for chromium is Cr<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, which contains the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ion. Molybdenum and tungsten form sulfides in which the metals exhibit oxidation states of 4+ and 6+.</para>

<title>Preparation of the Transition Elements</title>
<para id="fs-idm265294720">Ancient civilizations knew about iron, copper, silver, and gold. The time periods in human history known as the Bronze Age and Iron Age mark the advancements in which societies learned to isolate certain metals and use them to make tools and goods. Naturally occurring ores of copper, silver, and gold can contain high concentrations of these metals in elemental form (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_01_CuFeAu"/>). Iron, on the other hand, occurs on earth almost exclusively in oxidized forms, such as rust (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The earliest known iron implements were made from iron meteorites. Surviving iron artifacts dating from approximately 4000 to 2500 BC are rare, but all known examples contain specific alloys of iron and nickel that occur only in extraterrestrial objects, not on earth. It took thousands of years of technological advances before civilizations developed iron <term>smelting</term>, the ability to extract a pure element from its naturally occurring ores and for iron tools to become common.</para>

<para id="fs-idm229647584">Generally, the transition elements are extracted from minerals found in a variety of ores. However, the ease of their recovery varies widely, depending on the concentration of the element in the ore, the identity of the other elements present, and the difficulty of reducing the element to the free metal.</para>
<para id="fs-idm221083280">In general, it is not difficult to reduce ions of the <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block elements to the free element. Carbon is a sufficiently strong reducing agent in most cases. However, like the ions of the more active main group metals, ions of the <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis>-block elements must be isolated by electrolysis or by reduction with an active metal such as calcium.</para>
<para id="fs-idm203669440">We shall discuss the processes used for the isolation of iron, copper, and silver because these three processes illustrate the principal means of isolating most of the <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block metals. In general, each of these processes involves three principal steps: preliminary treatment, smelting, and refining.</para>
<list id="fs-idm273763504" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>Preliminary treatment. In general, there is an initial treatment of the ores to make them suitable for the extraction of the metals. This usually involves crushing or grinding the ore, concentrating the metal-bearing components, and sometimes treating these substances chemically to convert them into compounds that are easier to reduce to the metal.</item>
<item>Smelting. The next step is the extraction of the metal in the molten state, a process called smelting, which includes reduction of the metallic compound to the metal. Impurities may be removed by the addition of a compound that forms a slag—a substance with a low melting point that can be readily separated from the molten metal.</item>
<item>Refining. The final step in the recovery of a metal is refining the metal. Low boiling metals such as zinc and mercury can be refined by distillation. When fused on an inclined table, low melting metals like tin flow away from higher-melting impurities. Electrolysis is another common method for refining metals.</item>

<title>Isolation of Iron</title>
<para id="fs-idm124659712">The early application of iron to the manufacture of tools and weapons was possible because of the wide distribution of iron ores and the ease with which iron compounds in the ores could be reduced by carbon. For a long time, charcoal was the form of carbon used in the reduction process. The production and use of iron became much more widespread about 1620, when coke was introduced as the reducing agent. Coke is a form of carbon formed by heating coal in the absence of air to remove impurities.</para>
<para id="fs-idm281682464">The first step in the metallurgy of iron is usually roasting the ore (heating the ore in air) to remove water, decomposing carbonates into oxides, and converting sulfides into oxides. The oxides are then reduced in a blast furnace that is 80–100 feet high and about 25 feet in diameter (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_19_01_BlastFurn"/>) in which the roasted ore, coke, and limestone (impure CaCO<sub>3</sub>) are introduced continuously into the top.

The charges, as well as the atoms, must balance in reactions. The silver atom is being oxidized from the 0 oxidation state to the 1+ state. Whenever something loses electrons, something must also gain electrons (be reduced) to balance the equation. Oxygen is a good oxidizing agent for these reactions because it can gain electrons to go from the 0 oxidation state to the 2− state.</para>

No bond is ever 100% ionic, and the degree to which the electrons are evenly distributed determines many properties of the compound. Transition metal halides with low oxidation numbers form more ionic bonds. For example, titanium(II) chloride and titanium(III) chloride (TiCl<sub>2</sub> and TiCl<sub>3</sub>) have high melting points that are characteristic of ionic compounds, but titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) is a volatile liquid, consistent with having covalent titanium-chlorine bonds.

Oxides with low oxidation states tend to be more ionic, whereas those with higher oxidation states are more covalent. These variations in bonding are because the electronegativities of the elements are not fixed values. The electronegativity of an element increases with increasing oxidation state. Transition metals in low oxidation states have lower electronegativity values than oxygen; therefore, these metal oxides are ionic.

<para id="fs-idm158151328">A <term>superconductor</term> is a substance that conducts electricity with no resistance. This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity.</para>

(Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio.

Advances continued through the subsequent decades until, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a room-temperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is needed to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.</para><figure id="CNX_Chem_19_01_ResTemp" class="scaled-down">

<para id="fs-idm125495728">The transition metals are elements with partially filled <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis> orbitals, located in the <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>-block of the periodic table. The reactivity of the transition elements varies widely from very active metals such as scandium and iron to almost inert elements, such as the platinum metals. The type of chemistry used in the isolation of the elements from their ores depends upon the concentration of the element in its ore and the difficulty of reducing ions of the elements to the metals. Metals that are more active are more difficult to reduce.</para>
<para id="fs-idm228509360">Transition metals exhibit chemical behavior typical of metals. For example, they oxidize in air upon heating and react with elemental halogens to form halides. Those elements that lie above hydrogen in the activity series react with acids, producing salts and hydrogen gas. Oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates of transition metal compounds in low oxidation states are basic. Halides and other salts are generally stable in water, although oxygen must be excluded in some cases.
