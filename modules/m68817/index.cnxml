<para id="fs-idm1359840">In 1824, at the age of 28, Nicolas Léonard Sadi <term class="no-emphasis">Carnot</term> (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_16_03_Carnot"/>) published the results of an extensive study regarding the efficiency of steam heat engines. A later review of Carnot’s findings by Rudolf <term class="no-emphasis">Clausius</term> introduced a new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to the temperature at which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the <emphasis effect="italics">reversible</emphasis> heat (<emphasis effect="italics">q</emphasis><sub>rev</sub>) and the kelvin temperature (<emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis>). In thermodynamics, a <term>reversible process</term> is one that takes place at such a slow rate that it is always at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be “reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change in some condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a formalism required to support the development of various thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are truly reversible, rather they are classified as <emphasis effect="italics">irreversible</emphasis>.</para>

<para id="fs-idm158412992">The previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_16_02_Gas" document="m68816"/>) is a macroscopic example of this particle-in-a-box model.

<para id="fs-idm167918400">A similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat.

If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c) consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates.

<para id="fs-idm169703584">The relationships between entropy, microstates, and matter/energy dispersal described previously allow us to make generalizations regarding the relative entropies of substances and to predict the sign of entropy changes for chemical and physical processes.

In the solid phase, the atoms or molecules are restricted to nearly fixed positions with respect to each other and are capable of only modest oscillations about these positions. With essentially fixed locations for the system’s component particles, the number of microstates is relatively small. In the liquid phase, the atoms or molecules are free to move over and around each other, though they remain in relatively close proximity to one another. This increased freedom of motion results in a greater variation in possible particle locations, so the number of microstates is correspondingly greater than for the solid.

<para id="fs-idm135226880">The entropy of a substance is influenced by the structure of the particles (atoms or molecules) that comprise the substance. With regard to atomic substances, heavier atoms possess greater entropy at a given temperature than lighter atoms, which is a consequence of the relation between a particle’s mass and the spacing of quantized translational energy levels (a topic beyond the scope of this text). For molecules, greater numbers of atoms increase the number of ways in which the molecules can vibrate and thus the number of possible microstates and the entropy of the system.</para><para id="fs-idm96833856">Finally, variations in the types of particles affects the entropy of a system. Compared to a pure substance, in which all particles are identical, the entropy of a mixture of two or more different particle types is greater. This is because of the additional orientations and interactions that are possible in a system comprised of nonidentical components. For example, when a solid dissolves in a liquid, the particles of the solid experience both a greater freedom of motion and additional interactions with the solvent particles. This corresponds to a more uniform dispersal of matter and energy and a greater number of microstates. The process of dissolution therefore involves an increase in entropy, Δ<emphasis effect="italics">S</emphasis> &gt; 0.</para>

<para id="fs-idm12417328">Entropy (<emphasis effect="italics">S</emphasis>) is a state function that can be related to the number of microstates for a system (the number of ways the system can be arranged) and to the ratio of reversible heat to kelvin temperature. It may be interpreted as a measure of the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy in a system, and it is often described as representing the “disorder” of the system.</para>
<para id="fs-idm1916912">For a given substance, entropy depends on phase with <emphasis effect="italics">S</emphasis><sub>solid</sub> &lt; <emphasis effect="italics">S</emphasis><sub>liquid</sub> &lt; <emphasis effect="italics">S</emphasis><sub>gas</sub>. For different substances in the same physical state at a given temperature, entropy is typically greater for heavier atoms or more complex molecules. Entropy increases when a system is heated and when solutions form. Using these guidelines, the sign of entropy changes for some chemical reactions and physical changes may be reliably predicted.</para></section>
