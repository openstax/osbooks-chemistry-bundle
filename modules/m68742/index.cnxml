<para id="fs-idp51102864">Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules. However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and relative arrangements in space (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_CH2O"/>). A <term id="term-00001">bond angle</term> is the angle between any two bonds that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A <term id="term-00002">bond distance</term> (or bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in Ångstroms (1 Å = 10<sup>–10</sup> m) or picometers (1 pm = 10<sup>–12</sup> m, 100 pm = 1 Å).</para>

<title>VSEPR Theory</title>
<para id="fs-idp36050992"><term id="term-00003">Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory)</term> enables us to predict the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.</para>
<para id="fs-idp46353584">VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.</para>
<para id="fs-idp122770240">As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous BeF<sub>2</sub> molecule.

With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom.

<title>Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure</title>
<para id="fs-idp238100128">It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom"/> describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs.

<para id="fs-idp38238416">As seen in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3"/>, small distortions from the ideal angles in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom"/> can result from differences in repulsion between various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs.

<para id="fs-idp215771104">Consider formaldehyde, H<sub>2</sub>CO, which is used as a preservative for biological and anatomical specimens (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_CH2O"/>). This molecule has regions of high electron density that consist of two single bonds and one double bond.

The ideal bond angles in a trigonal pyramid are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than do bonding electrons. The H–N–H bond angles in NH<sub>3</sub> are slightly smaller than the 109.5° angle in a regular tetrahedron (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_Egeom"/>) because the lone pair-bonding pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_NH3"/>). <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom"/> illustrates the ideal molecular structures, which are predicted based on the electron-pair geometries for various combinations of lone pairs and bonding pairs.</para>

<caption>The molecular structures are identical to the electron-pair geometries when there are no lone pairs present (first column). For a particular number of electron pairs (row), the molecular structures for one or more lone pairs are determined based on modifications of the corresponding electron-pair geometry.</caption></figure><para id="fs-idp3259504">According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom"/>) are equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_Axeq"/>: an <term id="term-00011">axial position</term> (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an <term id="term-00012">equatorial position</term> (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in <link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_molgeom"/>, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of 90°, whereas the equatorial position has more space available because of the 120° bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.</para>

<title>Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment</title>
<para id="fs-idp30351200">As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (δ+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (δ–), as the electrons are pulled toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a <term id="term-00013">bond dipole moment</term>. The magnitude of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (<emphasis effect="italics">µ</emphasis>) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:</para>

Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.</para>

If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a <term id="term-00015">polar molecule</term> (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to be nonpolar. The <term id="term-00016">dipole moment</term> measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule as a whole.

Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.</para>

From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_07_06_CO2H2Odip"/>), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment.

<para id="fs-idp12666320">VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.</para>
