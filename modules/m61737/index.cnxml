<para id="fs-idp188136384">The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom’s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom’s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10<sup>−10</sup> m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10<sup>−15</sup> m—about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSize"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-idm171776576">Atoms—and the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose them—are extremely small. For example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2 <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> 10<sup>−23</sup> g, and an electron has a charge of less than 2 <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> 10<sup>−19</sup> C (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the <term>atomic mass unit (amu)</term> and the <term>fundamental unit of charge (e)</term>. The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu. (This isotope is known as “carbon-12” as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly <m:math><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mrow><m:mn>12</m:mn></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> 10<sup>−24</sup> g. (The <term>Dalton (Da)</term> and the <term>unified atomic mass unit (u)</term> are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.)

<para id="fs-idm166273840">A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is neutral. The electron has a charge of 1− and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton). The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in <link target-id="fs-idp90857696"/>. (An observant student might notice that the sum of an atom’s subatomic particles does not equal the atom’s actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu. This “missing” mass is known as the mass defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)</para><table id="fs-idp90857696" summary="This table gives the name, location, charge in C, unit charge, mass in A M U and mass in grams for electrons, protons and neutrons.

<para id="fs-idp27048016">The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its <term>atomic number (Z)</term>. This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its <term>mass number (A)</term>. The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: A – Z = number of neutrons.</para>

<title>Isotopes</title>
<para id="fs-idm240748912">The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the left of the element symbol (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSym"/>). The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol, but since this number defines the element’s identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For example, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24, 25, and 26, respectively. These isotopes can be identified as <sup>24</sup>Mg, <sup>25</sup>Mg, and <sup>26</sup>Mg. These isotope symbols are read as “element, mass number” and can be symbolized consistent with this reading. For instance, <sup>24</sup>Mg is read as “magnesium 24,” and can be written as “magnesium-24” or “Mg-24.” <sup>25</sup>Mg is read as “magnesium 25,” and can be written as “magnesium-25” or “Mg-25.” All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus.

<para id="fs-idp64386064">The occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer (<link target-id="CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec"/>), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample’s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation’s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a <emphasis effect="italics">mass spectrum</emphasis>) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications.</para>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec">
<media id="fs-idp221044352" alt="The left diagram shows how a mass spectrometer works, which is primarily a large tube that bends downward at its midpoint. The sample enters on the left side of the tube. A heater heats the sample, causing it to vaporize. The sample is also hit with a beam of electrons as it is being vaporized. Charged particles from the sample, called ions, are then accelerated and pass between two magnets. The magnetic field deflects the lightest ions most. The deflection of the ions is measured by a detector located on the right side of the tube. The graph to the right of the spectrometer shows a mass spectrum of zirconium. The relative abundance, as a percentage from 0 to 100, is graphed on the y axis, and the mass to charge ratio is graphed on the x axis. The sample contains five different isomers of zirconium. Z R 90, which has a mass to charge ratio of 90, is the most abundant isotope at about 51 percent relative abundance. Z R 91 has a mass to charge ratio of 91 and a relative abundance of about 11 percent. Z R 92 has a mass to charge ratio of 92 and a relative abundance of about 18 percent. Z R 94 has a mass to charge ratio of 94 and a relative abundance of about 18 percent. Z R 96, which has a mass to charge ratio of 96, is the least abundant zirconium isotope with a relative abundance of about 2 percent.">

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm148166800">An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly <m:math><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mrow><m:mn>12</m:mn></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 <m:math><m:mrow><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> 10<sup>−24</sup> g.</para>
<para id="fs-idp228494288">Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.</para>
<para id="fs-idm194069072">Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.</para>
